# Risk-stratification-of-Diabetic-patients
A care management organisation called WeCare wants to identify among its diabetic patients, the ones that are at high risk of getting re-admitted to the hospital.
As the star analyst of this organisation, your job is to identify high-risk diabetic patients through risk stratification.
Train and compare the performance of at least two machine learning algorithms and decide which one to use for predicting risk of readmission for the patient. 
Use trained model to stratify your population into 3 risk buckets:
High risk (Probability of readmission >0.7)
Medium risk (0.3 < Probability of readmission < 0.7)
Low risk (Probability of readmission < 0.3)
